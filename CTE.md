# CTE (Common Table Expressions)

Common Table Expressions (CTEs), is a powerful tool that simplifies complex SQL queries, improves readability, and enhances performance by defining temporary result sets that can be reused multiple times. Whether weâ€™re working on aggregating data, analyzing large datasets, or building complex reports, understanding how to use the WITH clause in SQL can significantly improve your querying experience.

**Example:
**
WITH temporaryTable (averageValue) AS (
    SELECT AVG(Salary)
    FROM Employee
)
        SELECT EmployeeID,Name, Salary 
        FROM Employee, temporaryTable 
        WHERE Employee.Salary > temporaryTable.averageValue;
